# Weather application

Build using ReactJS.<br>
Displays current weather information including air quality and background picture based on location inputed by user.

### How it works
Weather informations are provided by openweather api. User input (place name) is converted to longitute and latitude, which is used for displaying other relevant information. Alongside weather information, application displays air quaility informations provided by iqair api with color and number indicator of air quality. As well, it has a legend visible by hovering "i" symbol. For background is used flickr api. Location is based on longitude and latitude (converted from inputed location) and displays relevant image as background, dynamically.
